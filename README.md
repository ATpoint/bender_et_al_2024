# bender_et_al_2024

In this GitHub repository we document our preprocessing and analysis code for our paper `Bender et al. (2024) Redistribution of PU.1 partner transcription factor binding secures cell survival in leukemogenesis` formally accepted at `The EMBO Journal` and currently in press. 

Raw and processed NGS data were uploaded to GEO accession [GSE251674](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE251674) and will be released together with full code to reproduce all figures once the paper is publically available.
